    "#### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV, short for Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. Originally developed by Intel, it is now maintained by a community of developers under the OpenCV Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opencv is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first OpenCV version was 1.0. OpenCV is released under a BSD license and hence it’s free for both academic and commercial use. \n",
    "* It has C++, C, Python, and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. \n",
    "* When opencv was designed the main focus was real-time applications for computational efficiency. All things are written in optimized C/C++ to take advantage of multi-core processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Applications of OpenCV\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of applications which are solved using OpenCV, some of them are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Face recognition\n",
    "2. Automated inspection and surveillance\n",
    "3. number of people – count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)\n",
    "4. Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds\n",
    "5. Interactive art installations\n",
    "6. Anomaly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)\n",
    "7. Street view image stitching\n",
    "8. Video/image search and retrieval\n",
    "9. Robot and driver-less car navigation and control\n",
    "10. object recognition\n",
    "11. Medical image analysis\n",
    "12. Movies – 3D structure from motion\n",
    "13. TV Channels advertisement recognition"
